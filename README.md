<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe-Game</h2>
Welcome to the Repository. This repo is about the Tic Tac Toe game built by me.

<h2>Some Points</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Built purely using HTML, CSS, and JS</li>
  <li>In the game, the player gets the chance to select between the options 'X' or 'O'</li>
  <li>The player has an option for the New Game button which resets the whole game with just one click</li>
  <li>A nostalgic retro 8-bit background music is embedded in the website to give the player an awesome gaming experience</li>
</ul>
